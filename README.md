# Scrap-Management-System

I spearheaded the creation of a robust and user- friendly
web application utilizing Python and the Django
framework.

It has a simple and pleasant user interface using Bootstrap version 5.

I developed this project using the following:

Python
Django
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Bootstrap v5
Material Design Bootstrap Template
Font-Awesome

The system can be accessed by 2 users which are the admin and staff. The admin has the privilege to access Django's admin panel/site and manage the list of users. The staff users are only allowed to manage the site. 

Download/Install the following

Python (I used v3.9.1)
Django (I used v4.0.3)
PIP (for python modules installation)
Setup/Installation

Download and Extract the provided source code zip file. 
Open your Terminal/Command Prompt window. (make sure to add "python" and "pip" in your environment variables)
Change the working directory to the extracted source code folder. i.e. cd C:\Users\Personal-23\Desktop\django_ims
Run the following commands:

pip install Django
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
Open a web browser and browse http://localhost:8000/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Note: I might forget to list some other modules/libraries. Kindly Install the missing modules if any occurred.
